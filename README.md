# UN-HACKABLE PASSWORD 2020 <h1>

## GOAL <h2>
My goal on this project was to create a random password generator, including all the criteria a user would like to include to better strengthen their password.

## Thought Process <h2>

**HTML** 
* For this project my HTML went untouched

**CSS**
*  I started by going over the already in place code and figuring out what I needed to add around it
* I added an initial prompt asking how long the user would like the password to be and then confirming the length or telling the user to re enter with in the limits
* I then added my character variables (lowercase, uppercase, symbols and numbers)
* //Commented out in script file (work in progress section : After deciding what characters the user wants to in their password in alert will then confirm what they choose
* VOILA! PASSWORD GENERATED
